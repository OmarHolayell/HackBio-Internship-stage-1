# SRplot: Free Online Data Visualization Tool
SRplot is a free online tool that makes graphs easier for scientists who don't have programming skills. existing visualizing tools often require coding skills in languages like R, Python or Perl. This is a challenge for biologists who don't have programming experience. Bioinformaticians create tools to handle specific tasks, like analysing genomic data, annotations, or visualizing gene expression.

These tools are expensive as many of the most popular graphing tools like GraphPad Prism, Microsoft Excel, and Origin are paid.

SRplot solves these problems by allowing users to create many different types of graphs directly in their web browser without needing to any programming skills with free access to non-commercial users.

# Method:
SRplot provides over 120 Python and R-coded modules designed for visualising and generating graphs from biomedical and bioinformatics data. While many of these functions were not originally developed for SRplot, they have been optimized and enhanced.

# Results: 
SRplot developed for wet lab biologists, it contains 120 function covers genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics with many graphing types as

(1) basic graphs (bar plots, line plots, pie plots and scatter plots )

(2) genome plots(SNP density)

(3) transcriptome plots(heatmap, volcano plots, violin plots, bubble plots and chord plots)

(4) epigenome plots(metagene plots and motif plots)
